  cpu:
    request: '100m'
    limit: '1000m'
  memory:
    request: '128Mi'
    limit: '1Gi'
  probe:
    path: '/health'
    port: 80
    exec:
    delay:  30

  ports: what ports on the container to expose
  - https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.19/#containerport-v1-core
  cpu:
    request: cpu request is guaranteed
    limit: container will be throttled at cpu limit
  memory:
    request: memory request is guaranteed
    limit: container will be restarted at memory limit
  probe:
    path: the server path to ping for health checks, set to "disable" to disable checks
    port: the server port to ping for health checks
    exec: an array of strings that run a command on the container instead of checking an http endpoint
    delay: number of seconds to wait before liveliness and readiness probes start
    startup: number of failed startup checks before restarting, checks start after 10 seconds and happen every 6 seconds
  root: run the image as root
  privileged: give the image 'privileged' permissions
